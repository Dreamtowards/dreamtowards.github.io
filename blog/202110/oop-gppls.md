- Instance Representation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism


### _design_points.

### Member-Classes / Static-Classes.
In java, member-classes are allowed, which implicitly holds a reference to the owner-class.

While in csharp, Inner-Classes all are independent. the Static-Classes just saying all member are static.


### Explicit 'self' declaration.
